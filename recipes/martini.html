        <p>With only 3 essential ingredients, a classic martini is one of the easiest cocktails around. Its origins, like many other famous drinks, are not totally clear. Though lots of folks think its title may come from the Martini brand of vermouth.</p>
        <p>Though the original recipe for a martini includes gin, vodka makes for a clean and approach version of the original. The martini's simplicity has no bearing on its elegance. You will feel on top of the world after your first sip. Before you start, make sure your vodka and vermouth is qualityâ€”since they make up the drink, the cheap stuff just won't do. You can save the cheap stuff for our Peanut Butter Cup Martini.</p>
        <p>Here is a quick martini guide for folks who don't know what all the classic martini vocabulary:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dry:</strong>A martini with little to no vermouth.</li>
                <li><strong>Wet:</strong>A martini with a bit more vermouth.</li>
                <li><strong>Dirty:</strong>A martini that has been spiked with olive juice, that is spiked with an olive.</li>
            </ul>
